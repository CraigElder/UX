# Lack of information About Drone Links

Drone links can be configured in a couple of different ways, and some GCSs do not accept more than one type of connection. Having information about the link is crucial to do anything with the drone, but most interfaces do not present instructions or link the user to troubleshooting information about it.

###Andropilot

The program requires a radio connection to a Radio Controller (RC) in order to get access to drone parameters and functionality, but there is no information anywhere about this requirement. 

Only by testing and using other GCS softwares, or by looking particularly for this information is that unfamiliar users are able to connect the drone in this program.

###UGCS

This application presents a lot of lists of cameras, vehicles, etc, but no information about how to connect the drone to it. There are no buttons or instructions to help the user accomplish the task.
