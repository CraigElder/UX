# Hard-To-Use Mission Planning Tools in Broader Solutions

Occur especially in applications that try to accomplish all the tasks required to run a mission. Generally they present mission planning tools with hard-to-use interfaces (place points by coordinates, complementary controls spread all over the screen , etc).

###Andropilot

No hints about how to place waypoints in the map (also, long press sometimes did not work properly). After this, trying to click on the WP icon didnâ€™t produce any result. The upper blue bar is the waypoint configuration tool, but there is no indication of it and no hint about what fields could be adjusted.

###DJI Groundstation

Waypoints are inserted through the panel placed at the right side of the screen, by typing the coordinates. There is no sort of tool that uses map clicks to accomplish this task.
