# Pre-Flight Checkages

Some GCS interfaces already present good ideas about communicating to users crucial
information concerning the operation of drones;
* incompatibility alerts
* usage instructions or safety checkages, that prevent the user from flying with problems in
the drone.

These are the best pre-flight checkages by tool:

###DroneDeploy

There is a pre-takeoff checkage that is performed before clearing the drone for takeoff.

Besides having feedback about all flight phases (pre-takeoff, takeoff, flight and landing), it also warns users if the mission will exceed battery time and asks people to make the path shorter.


###Tower/DroidPlanner 2

These apps contain a pre-flight checklist, which is a very useful tool for mitigating the problems that can occur during drone flight.
Currently it is only a list and has no automated features, but the initiative towards the implementation of safety checkages in the flow is very positive.

Very clear alerts about calibration problems that prevent the drone from flying.
